* Co-developed with the software team at UCSD AUVSI, "Heimdall" is a distributed-processing (client/server networked) computer vision detection and classification system.

* It is modular and reconfigurable for flexibility; components can be added in either of its two languages, C++ or Python.
* Uses OpenCV and includes additional machine learning algorithms for optimal performance.
* This open-source software is available on GitHub: [link](http://github.com/UCSD-AUVSI/Heimdall)
