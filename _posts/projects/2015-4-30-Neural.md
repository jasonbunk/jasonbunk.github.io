* A piece of my research for the UCSD AUVSI (Autonomous Airplane Team) computer vision suite (source code is available there).

* Goal is to simultaneously classify and find the orientation of isolated alphanumeric characters with no context... significantly harder than the classic MNIST numeric digits benchmark!
* Implementation in Theano (with Python) updated based on the latest research in the field.
* So far, results demonstrate at least 90% accuracy with cross-validation and on a test set, which is the goal.
