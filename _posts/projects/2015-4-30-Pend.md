Computer vision for feedback measurements for an inverted pendulum control system, using SFML for cross-platform visualization and interactivity.

Physical hardware is a re-purposed HP printer and an Arduino with motor shield for motor control.

Feedback: Computer vision with OpenCV and a webcam.

State estimation: An Extended Kalman Filter that compensates for delayed feedback (like a Smith predictor), since the webcam and OpenCV processing introduce significant measurement delay.

Control: LQR for linearization about setpoint.

Summary of Results: The 15 cm pendulum was balanced and stable for as long as approx. 1 second; it fell mostly because it runs out of track space. Improvements could be made by using a faster webcam or physically building a longer track which would allow better recoveries when it starts falling. The achieved goal was to learn about attempting real-time control using cheap, noisy, and delayed sensors and finding the limits of what can be done.
